            Your personal style doesn’t end with what you put on your body. It’s also about how you decorate your space. Oftentimes, when I walk into a room I can get a glimpse of that person’s personality even if I haven’t met them before. The way that they organize the books on their shelf or the little trinkets and posters that adorn their walls give me a lot of insight into their character. With that being said, decorating your room should be for you and not for other people.

            Some decorations I love to include are little figurines or gifts from friends and family. Having them carefully placed all around my room brings me joy when I turn to my left and see a gift that sparks a happy memory, or pictures of my friends and family to remind myself what I do all of this for- the people I love. There is really no rhyme or reason as to what you put in your room as long as you like it. Some people opt for a more minimalist style, so very little decoration or just a very clean look overall, whereas some people really love to decorate the walls with things that they love, or little keepsakes from places they’ve visited. The magic is all what you make of it!
