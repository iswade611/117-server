        <p>
            The only way to truly feel confident in your style and who you are is if it feels true to you. While there is a lot of advice and helpful tips on how to develop your personal style, such as this website, if your outfit makes you feel more like an impostor than yourself- wear what makes you comfortable!
        </p>

        <p>
            It can be easy to get in a cycle of judging yourself and comparing yourself to others, but that’s not what should be done. Clothing and decoration is all about expressing yourself, and it should be something that’s enjoyable! Don’t let anyone tell you what you can or cannot wear or let their judgments of you dim your light. Additionally, while going on shopping sprees for new items or decor can be fun, sometimes the best experimentation and stretching of the imagination comes when we use what we already have. So go into your closet and try to utilize what you already own before going online to buy a new piece, or start by hand-crafting your decor to give it a personal touch.
