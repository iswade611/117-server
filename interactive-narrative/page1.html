                Finding your aesthetic is an enigma that has long been sought after. But one does not find a personal style unless they are in tune with themselves. There are many different ways to go about finding your aesthetic- and I will help you learn more about how to navigate the dreaded questions of “what will I wear today?” or “do these decorations make my room look trendy or like I’m still in elementary school?” 
                To start off at the most basic concept: aesthetics. There are many to choose from, and more often than not I go back and forth between many different aesthetics depending on my mood or where I’m at in my life.

                The first one is street style: think big graphic tees, baggy jeans or cargo pants, a pair of athletic shoes, and just a lot of oversized clothing. This can be seen in the picture on the right hand side of the screen- the layered graphic tee with baggy pants and tennis shoes. A second aesthetic that I find myself playing around with a lot is clean and minimalistic. This means choosing a lot of basic, staple pieces (a pair of jeans that fit just to your liking with a basic tee that can be paired with anything). A simple low-rise jean with a white cardigan can really make a colorful tee such as the purple one pop, and the white in my cardigan goes with the white string that is tied around my jeans in a belt fashion. While there are many different other aesthetics, the most important takeaway is that aesthetics often mix, change, and intertwine with one another. This is how one creates their own unique aesthetic.
