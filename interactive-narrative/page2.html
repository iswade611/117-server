            I once heard that our style from when we were young is its truest, most pure form of what we love the most. So go back into your photo album and try to find a picture of an outfit that you love- or used to love- when you were younger. Try styling it again today similarly or mixing up some pieces to make it uniquely the person you are today, and you might be surprised.

            I chose this gray sweater and blue jean with crocs from when I was young to recreate. While I didn’t have a slim-fitting gray sweater, I had a baggier one that seemed to fit more of my current style. I never grew out of my baggy jean phase, which I’m thankful for. The crocs add a playful and youthful touch that dress down the piece, but it can also be dressed up with tennis shoes, loafers, or ballet flats, to name a few.

            Often I find that inspiration can come from others, and celebrities take simple pieces or old trends and bring them back to the forefront. Looking for inspiration in your favorite artist or actress can help you see what fashion statements you like and don’t like. For this challenge, I chose to recreate Olivia Rodrigo, a popular half-Asian American pop-rock singer because I adore the way she takes a basic piece and breathes new life into it.

            I also wanted to challenge myself by wearing a hat, which is something I don’t do very often. Turns out, I like hats styled on me more than I would’ve imagined! While the outfit is fairly simple and I had the majority of the pieces, I was still able to feel like myself and make it my own by choosing more of a statement jewelry piece for my earring as opposed to her subtle jewelry look.
